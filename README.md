## üõ† More LLM Learning Resources

Additional high-quality **GitHub repositories** and **resources** for learning about LLMs, fine-tuning, and deployment:

### General LLM & AI Learning Resources
- [Awesome Prompt Engineering](https://github.com/promptslab/Awesome-Prompt-Engineering) ‚Äì hand-curated resources for Prompt Engineering. 
- [Awesome LLM Papers](https://github.com/Hannibal046/Awesome-LLM) ‚Äì A collection of the most important papers on LLMs.  

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) ‚Äì Standardizing AI Tool & Data Integration

Since Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the new hotness, noteing that MCP is an open protocol that allows LLMs to access **external data sources** and **execute actions** via structured tools. It eliminates the need for one-off API integrations, making it easier to build AI assistants that can fetch **relevant context** and interact with applications in a **safe, controlled way**.

- [MCP Introduction & Docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) ‚Äì Official documentation and protocol overview.  
- [Awesome MCP Clients](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-clients) ‚Äì A curated list of tools and applications implementing MCP.  
- [MCP GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) ‚Äì Official SDKs (Python, TypeScript, Java) and example implementations.
