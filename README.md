# Prompt Engineering Resources
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/limyewjin/llm-tutorial/blob/main/Prompt_Engineering_Tutorial.ipynb) - Prompt Engineering Tutorial

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting prompts to get desired results from large language models (LLMs). This repository compiles an opinionated simple list of free resources on prompt engineering and LLMs, covering official guides, industry insights, tutorials, and advanced techniques, including my own interactive tutorial.

## üõ† More LLM Learning Resources

Additional high-quality **GitHub repositories** and **resources** for learning about LLMs, fine-tuning, and deployment:

### General LLM & AI Learning Resources
- [Awesome Prompt Engineering](https://github.com/promptslab/Awesome-Prompt-Engineering) ‚Äì hand-curated resources for Prompt Engineering. 
- [Awesome LLM Papers](https://github.com/Hannibal046/Awesome-LLM) ‚Äì A collection of the most important papers on LLMs.  

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) ‚Äì Standardizing AI Tool & Data Integration

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that allows LLMs to access **external data sources** and **execute actions** via structured tools. It eliminates the need for one-off API integrations, making it easier to build AI assistants that can fetch **relevant context** and interact with applications in a **safe, controlled way**.

- [MCP Introduction & Docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) ‚Äì Official documentation and protocol overview.  
- [Awesome MCP Clients](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-clients) ‚Äì A curated list of tools and applications implementing MCP.  
- [MCP GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) ‚Äì Official SDKs (Python, TypeScript, Java) and example implementations.
